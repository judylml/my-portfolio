            We conducted <b>Instagram poll surveys</b> to gather insights into

            explored common practices and challenges for reducing food waste. By
            understanding these behaviors, we aim to identify opportunities for
            creating more effective strategies to promote <b>sustainability</b>{" "}

            The survey results suggest that while most users make an effort to

            issues with <b>food waste</b> still persist.
