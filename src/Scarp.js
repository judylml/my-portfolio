          <h3>1. Redesigned Information Architecture</h3>
          <p> Content buckets were restructured for <strong>intuitive access</strong>, and a robust <strong>labeling system</strong> was introduced to <strong>streamline navigation</strong>. The <strong>website interface</strong> underwent a <strong>redesign</strong> to enhance <strong>user-friendliness</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2. Document Management Overhaul</h3>
            <p>A <strong>centralized document repository</strong> was established, reducing reliance on <strong>email</strong> for <strong>document sharing</strong>. This overhaul facilitated <strong>efficient collaboration</strong> and addressed <strong>version control issues</strong>. The implementation included a process for <strong>continuous document updates</strong> and <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p>
            <h3>3. Enhanced Communication</h3>
            <p> The intranet has been upgraded to include an interactive <strong>"Ask the Team"</strong> section, allowing users to directly reach out to specific individuals based on the <strong>category</strong> of their questions. This intuitive feature promotes <strong>streamlined communication</strong> and ensures that inquiries are directed to the most <strong>relevant team members</strong>.</p>

          <h2>üîç Research</h2>
          <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
          <p>
        I first proceeded by performing <strong>research</strong> to uncover the <strong>challenges</strong> faced by the <strong>SCARP department</strong>. I aimed to identify the primary <strong>pain points</strong> experienced by users of the <strong>SCARP intranet</strong> to solve their problems and offer a more <strong>efficient solution</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main <strong>pain points</strong> faced by users were summarized as follows:
      </p>
            <div className="project-image">
          <img src={findings} alt="findings"/>
          </div>
          <p>
          Understanding and addressing these pain points was pivotal to ensure that the new SCARP intranet would be tailored to meet specific <b>user needs</b>.

          <h2>üñåÔ∏è Designs</h2>
          <h3>01. Homepage Look</h3>
          <p>The initial homepage poorly reflected the <b>SCARP brand</b> and did <b>not</b> have proper content and <b>visual layout</b>.</p>
          <p>
          After discussing with the <strong>stakeholders</strong>, I created my <strong>lo-fi wireframes</strong> and transformed them into <strong>high-fidelity designs</strong>. I considered the fact that they wanted to keep the <strong>branding</strong> of the <strong>SCARP department</strong> that emphasizes <strong>orange</strong> and <strong>blue tones</strong>. This also helps maintain <strong>consistency</strong> and <strong>brand identity</strong> throughout the designs. I was also mindful of the limitations of <strong>SharePoint</strong> and created my designs based on what was <strong>possible</strong>.
      </p>
      <div className="project-image">
          <img src={d1} alt="design 1"/>
          </div>
          <p>Changes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Incorporated</strong> the brand‚Äôs <strong>color scheme</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined navigation</strong> for improved <strong>accessibility</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic hero image</strong> for engaging <strong>focal point</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Restructured content buckets</strong> for <strong>intuitive access</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Updated typography</strong> for improved <strong>readability</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, a more <strong>cohesive</strong>, <strong>user-friendly</strong>, and <strong>aesthetically pleasing</strong> design compared to the old version.
      </p></p>
      <h3>02. Homepage Content</h3>
      <div className="project-image">
          <img src={d2} alt="design 2"/>
          </div>
      <p>Changes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Previous content</strong> was <strong>irrelevant</strong> on the homepage.</li>
        <li>Replaced with <strong>categorized cards</strong> for <strong>efficient navigation</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaner design</strong> reduces <strong>clutter</strong>, enhancing <strong>visibility</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear presentation</strong> aids <strong>understanding</strong> of <strong>system status</strong> and <strong>interaction</strong>.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <h3>03. Contact page</h3>
      <p>
        The initial <strong>'Contact Us'</strong> page had a <strong>list view</strong> of all the contacts, which is <strong>challenging to navigate</strong> and <strong>comprehend quickly</strong>. Therefore, I decided to introduce the content using <strong>cards</strong> so that users can easily <strong>scan</strong> and <strong>identify individual contacts</strong>, improving <strong>visibility</strong> and <strong>recognition</strong>. This emphasizes the importance of presenting information in a format that enhances <strong>user understanding</strong> and <strong>engagement</strong>.
      </p>
      <div className="project-image">
          <img src={d3} alt="design 3"/>
          </div>
          <h2>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        My primary responsibilities also involved <strong>translating the designs</strong> into SharePoint as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensured <strong>seamless integration</strong> of new <strong>information architecture</strong> and <strong>design aesthetics</strong> into the SharePoint environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Configured SharePoint settings, created and organized <strong>document libraries</strong>, and <strong>customized intranet appearance</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Produced <strong>libraries</strong> for each page, and created <strong>views for sub-categories</strong>, but faced limitations in <strong>flexibility</strong> due to SharePoint constraints.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>üßêFuture: Usability Studies</h2>
      <p>
        I am planning to conduct <strong>usability studies</strong> to evaluate the effectiveness of the redesigned <strong>SCARP intranet</strong>. After finalizing the <strong>hi-fi designs</strong>, diverse faculty and staff members will engage with the intranet to perform daily tasks. These studies aim to gather <strong>insights</strong>, identify <strong>pain points</strong>, and perform <strong>design iterations</strong> to improve the <strong>user experience</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>üé¨ <strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the SCARP Intranet redesign project has been a comprehensive journey aimed at addressing <strong>usability challenges</strong> and <strong>inefficiencies</strong> faced by faculty and staff. Through a <strong>user-centric design process</strong>, I have restructured <strong>information architecture</strong>, enhanced <strong>navigation</strong>, and introduced a <strong>cleaner</strong>, more <strong>efficient layout</strong>. The <strong>iterative nature</strong> of the design and incorporation of <strong>feedback</strong> from stakeholders ensures that the final intranet meets the specific needs of the SCARP community.
      </p>
      <p>
        This redesign not only improves the overall <strong>user experience</strong> but also aligns with key <strong>design principles</strong>, such as <strong>information architecture</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and <strong>efficiency of use</strong>. The introduction of new features, such as the <strong>"ask the team"</strong> section, aims to ensure improved <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong>.
